    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Yomari, also called yamari, is a delicacy of the Newar community in Nepal. It is a steamed dumpling that consists of an external covering of rice flour with sweet fillings such as chaku. The delicacy plays a very important role in Newa society, and is a key part of the festival of Yomari Punhi. According to some, the triangular shape of the Yamari is a symbolical representation of one half of the Shadkona, the symbol of Saraswati and wisdom.</p>
